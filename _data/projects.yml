- intro:
  description: "These are various projects that I have implemented over the years. Source code can be found on my Github."

- project:
  title: Experiments with Reddit Comments
  link: "#"
  tagline: "Analyzed one month of Reddit comments using Apache Spark and trained a LSTM recurrent neural network on data from specific subreddits in order to predict comments using deep learning strategies.Gained key insights about the data and visualized it in Apache Spark."
- project:
  title: Path Finding and Collision Detection in Virtual Environment
  link: "#"
  tagline: "Implemented the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm in order to find a path between two points in an environment and developed collision detection techniques to avoid obstacles in the environment.  Improved the algorithm for use with polygonal robots in the environment."
- project:
  title: Stock Market Analysis and Prediction tool
  link: "#"
  tagline: "Developed a web based application which presented users with a dashboard to buy/sell stocks. Applied Machine Learning techniques such as Bayesian Curve Fitting, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines to historical and real-time data of various stock prices and predicted whether stock of a particular company should be bought or held or sold."
- project:
  title: Chess Data Analytics using Hadoop
  link: "#"
  tagline: "Analyzed 22 GB of chess data to determine statistics using Amazonâ€™s Elastic MapReduce (EMR) and S3. Determined percentage of victories for players using Black and White and number of draws for 28 million records."
- project:
  title: Predictive and Corrective Text input for desktop editors
  link: "#"
  tagline: "Developed an improved text editor for Windows machines using Visual Studio(C#). Implemented suffix trees for data compression and utilized n-grams and frequency analysis to facilitate word prediction.Authored and presented a technical paper regarding the same at the International Conference on Advances in Human Machine Interaction, 2016 which was published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library"
